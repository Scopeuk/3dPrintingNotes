# Foreword
First and foremost, this is a work in progress and is incomplete, pull requests and feedback welcome.   
The source repository can be found at <https://github.com/Scopeuk/3dPrintingNotes>   
   
This document aims to help a new user understand the commands they are likely to encounter in setup guides or similar, it necessarily skips over some elements of detail and nuance in favour of clarity.
The intention of this document is not to replace existing guides to instalation or update of klipper, that subject has been covered extensively and well elsewhere.
This document aims to let someone unfamiliar with linux understand what the commands given in guides do as an aid to trouble shooting and to give confidence.
This is not intended to be a be all and end all guide to any of these commands.
As part of the shortcuts taken to make this accessible guidance around system commands and application installation will focus on tools used by debian and it's derivatives (ubunutu, raspberry pi os etc) as these are the most commonly used distributions for new users.
